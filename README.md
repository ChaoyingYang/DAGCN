# Domain Adversarial Graph Convolutional network (DAGCN)
This code is about the implementation of [Domain Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network for Fault Diagnosis Under Variable Working Conditions].

# Note
The DAGCN consists of a CNN and a [MRF_GCN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9280401), and the framework of this code is based on [Unsupervised Deep Transfer Learning for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis: An Open Source and Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12528v1).
